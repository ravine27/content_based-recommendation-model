🎯 Recommendation Model System

This project focuses on building a Recommendation System, which is an intelligent model designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences, behavior, or past interactions.

Recommendation systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix (movies), Amazon (products), Spotify (music), and many others to enhance user experience and engagement.

🧠 Types of Recommendation Models

There are three main types of recommendation systems implemented or explored in this project:

Content-Based Filtering

Recommends items similar to those the user has liked or interacted with before.

Works by analyzing the features or attributes of items (e.g., genre, tags, keywords).

Example: If a user watches a sci-fi movie, the system recommends other sci-fi movies.

Collaborative Filtering

Recommends items based on user behavior and preferences of similar users.

It assumes that users who agreed in the past will agree in the future.

Example: If two users liked similar movies, one user’s favorite movie can be recommended to the other.

Hybrid Recommendation System

Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.

Provides more accurate and robust recommendations by leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

Example: Netflix uses hybrid models to consider both user preferences and item similarity.

⚙️ Project Overview

In this project, we develop and test different recommendation approaches to:

Analyze user-item interaction data

Generate personalized recommendations

Compare the performance of different models

Enhance accuracy using hybrid strategies
